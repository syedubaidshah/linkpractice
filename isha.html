    <h1>Isha</h1>
    <p>The Isha prayer (Arabic: صلاة العشاء ṣalāt al-ʿišāʾ, "night prayer") is one of the five mandatory salah (Islamic prayer).

        The five daily prayers collectively are one pillar of the Five Pillars of Islam, in Sunni Islam, and one of the ten Practices of the Religion (Furū al-Dīn) according to Shia Islam.
        
        In Persian it is known as نماز عشاء (Nemaze ʿišāʾ). In Kashmiri, it is known as Khoftan Nemaz. Likewise in Punjabi, it is called Khuftaan di namaz</p>
