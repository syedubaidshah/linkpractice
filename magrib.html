    <h1>Magrib</h1>
    <p>According to Sunni Muslims, the period for Maghrib prayer starts just after sunset, following Asr prayer, and ends at the beginning of night, the start of the Isha prayer. As for Shia Muslims, since they allow Maghrib and Isha prayers to be performed one after another, the period for Maghrib prayer extends until the midnight. Except for the Hanafi school, however, Sunni Muslims are also permitted to combine Maghrib and Isha prayers if they are traveling and incapable of performing the prayers separately. In this case, the period for Maghrib prayer extends from sunset to dawn, as with Shiites. Amongst Sunnis, Salafis allow the combining of two consecutive prayers (Maghrib & Isha'a, Dhuhr & 'Asr) for a wide range of reasons; such as when various needs arise or due to any difficulty (taking precedence from Hanbali and Shafiite schools).</p>
